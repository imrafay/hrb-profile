To reach a compromise, I proposed we create a small prototype implementing both solutions (Context API and Redux) for the feature.

To resolve this, I refactored the code to use React’s useCallback and useMemo hooks to memoize functions and calculations that were being recreated on every render. I also implemented React.memo on child components to prevent them from re-rendering unless their props changed. I checked the state updates to ensure that only relevant state changes triggered re-renders, avoiding redundant updates.",
