                    "A CDN (Content Delivery Network) is a network of servers spread across different locations worldwide that helps deliver content (like websites, images, videos, or files) faster to users. Instead of all users having to connect to a single server (which could be far away from them), a CDN stores copies of the content on servers that are closer to users geographically.",

                    "Without a CDN: Imagine if a website is hosted on a server in Berlin, and someone in New York tries to access it. The data would have to travel all the way from Berlin to New York, which takes time.",
                    "With a CDN: The website's content is copied to servers located in many places around the world. So when the person in New York accesses the site, they get the content from a nearby server (maybe in New York or another close city), making the website load faster."
